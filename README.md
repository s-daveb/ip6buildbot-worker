# bastille-templates

Much like Docker, FreeBSD's Bastille uses template directories with `Bastillefile`s to allow users to deploy applications in a reproducible, automated way.

This repository contains Bastillefile templates I've created when I've found that the official repository does not have the application I need to deploy.
